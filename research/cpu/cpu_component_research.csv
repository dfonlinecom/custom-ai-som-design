The bare processor is not sold retail.","Not publicly available for the bare processor or 100-unit quantity. Pricing is only available for integrated systems (laptops, mini-PCs) or through direct inquiry with embedded partners. For example, the ASRock Industrial 4X4 BOX AI300 Series (which uses the AI 7 350 and AI 5 340, not the AI 9 365) does not have public pricing, but a similar consumer mini-PC (Beelink SER9 Pro with AI 9 365) is listed at approximately $829.00 USD for a single unit. Wholesale pricing for the bare chip is not disclosed.","The AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 is a mobile processor (FP8 package) and is not sold as a standalone chip through major component distributors like DigiKey or Mouser. Availability is currently tied to System-on-Module (SOM) solutions and mini-PCs from industrial partners.

- **ASRock Industrial 4X4 BOX AI300 Series:** Expected availability is Q1 2025, as announced in January 2025. This is the closest to a SOM/embedded solution found.
- **General Availability:** The processor itself is available in consumer laptops and mini-PCs from major OEMs (HP, MSI, ASUS, etc.). Direct availability of the bare processor for SOM design is not publicly listed and would require direct engagement with AMD's embedded or partner channels. Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) is not publicly disclosed for the bare processor.","The AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 is a BGA mobile processor and is not sold directly by major component distributors (DigiKey, Mouser, etc.).
