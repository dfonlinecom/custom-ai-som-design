### **AI Power Tracking System:**

**The Concept:**

**Every custom part has stats tracked by AI.**

**How It Works:**

1. **User 3D prints custom weapon shell**
2. **Embeds sensors** (IR transmitter, accelerometer, etc.)
3. **Registers design** in PlayPod app
4. **AI scans design** (via camera)
5. **AI assigns stats** based on:
   - Size (larger = more armor)
   - Sensors (more IR LEDs = more firepower)
   - Weight (heavier = slower movement)
   - Complexity (more features = higher power)

**Example:**

**Player A:**
- **Armor Rating:** 600 (3D-printed chest plate with 4x IR receivers)
- **Firepower:** 900 (Custom rifle with 3x IR transmitters)
- **Speed:** 70 (Heavy gear slows movement)
- **Special:** Shield Generator (custom sensor detects incoming hits, activates shield)

**Player B:**
- **Armor Rating:** 300 (Lightweight vest)
- **Firepower:** 500 (Standard pistol)
- **Speed:** 120 (Fast movement)
- **Special:** Stealth Mode (IR jammer, harder to detect)

**Balance System:**

- AI ensures fair play
- High armor = low speed
- High firepower = high cost (more cards needed)
- Special abilities = cooldown timers

**Leaderboard:**

- Top builders featured
- Most creative designs
- Highest power ratings
- Best balanced builds
