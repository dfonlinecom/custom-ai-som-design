## ✅ Why This Strategy is Perfect

1.  **Low Barrier to Entry:** The **$759 Super Early Bird** price makes it one of the most affordable AI development kits on the market, attracting a large audience.
2.  **Clear Upgrade Path:** The **+535% performance boost** for just $240 is a powerful incentive for backers to choose the "Plus" model.
3.  **Addresses Two Markets:** It caters to both the hobbyist/developer market and the professional/power-user market simultaneously.
4.  **Reduces Risk:** Even if the "Plus" model doesn't sell as well, the "Entry Level" model is still a highly profitable and desirable product on its own.
5.  **Maximizes Funding:** By offering two tiers, you increase the potential funding total by capturing backers at different price points.
